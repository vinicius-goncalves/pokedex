  ## Introdution
  One of my first projects, Pokedex98 was a beginner project using tools like [PokÃ©API][pokeapi], that beginners usually use when learning HTTP request for the first time. Instead of building a simple project, I challenge myself by creating a PokÃ©dex with Window 98-based themes. The project has features such as drag-and-drop popups, search PokÃ©mons by name or ID, infinite scroll, and more.
